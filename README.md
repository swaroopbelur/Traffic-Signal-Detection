## Traffic-Signal-Detection
A driver security system that ensures road safety using Machine Intelligence to detect road signs and accordingly notify the driver or override the control of the car and take necessary action. The system utilizes OpenCV 3.0 with Python to detect road signs in real time using a USB 2.0 camera connected to the Raspberry Pi. The motors of the car are controlled using the Rpi GPIO pins alongwith a L293D motor driver circuit. 18560 Li-ion Batteries are used to power the system.

#### HARDWARE USED:
1. Raspberry Pi <br>
2. geared motors (in this case fixed to the chassis) <br>
3. L293D Motor Driver (eagle schematics included in the repository) <br>
4. Rechargeable batteries (18560 salvaged from an old laptop) <br>
5. TP4056 (18560 Li-ion battery charger) <br>
6. XL6009 (DC-DC Boost Converter) <br>

**NOTE:  ***Python files are executable only on a Raspberry Pi (any version)*
